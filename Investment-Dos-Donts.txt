Don'ts:
-------
1) Don't Invest in Government Companies (ie Government's holdings > 50 %)
    Rationale   : Management of such does not have the enough contorl to take progressive decisions 
    Example     : Indian oil corp, paid an additional dividend in FY2019 than usual because of pressure from
                  government, as dividend payout will reduce the share price by that amount on exdate and since 
                  this dividend could have been used for growth, hence it was one of many reasons that turned away
                  investors from that stock. (IOC has lost 40 % from FY2018 to FY2020).

2) Don't Invest in Companies that has derivatives.
    Rationale   : The stocks with derivatives, (ie Futures and Option contracts), are usually largecaps,
                  and potential for growth in largecaps are limited compared to Midcaps or smallcaps, but
                  that does not imply that risk in these stock are lower. Large caps with derivatives, during 
                  economic recessions and slowdowns, have lost marketcap faster than midcaps or smallcaps, as
                  the stocks with derivatives, there are now upper and lower circuit trating limits.
    Example     : On 21th Sep 2018, DHFL lost 43 % of it's market cap in single trading day.
